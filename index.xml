However as in every system design it all depends on the context.</description></item><item><title>Scaling for Millions of Users</title><link>https://isurubuddhika.dev/notes/scaling-for-million-users/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://isurubuddhika.dev/notes/scaling-for-million-users/</guid><description>Scenario : A system that caters large number of users with a web front-end and a mobile app.
Things to consider
Choice of Database
For most cases relational database like MySQL would work Things to consider when going for NoSQL Application requires super law latency Unstructured data or data has no relations Need to store a massive amount of data Scale the application tier
