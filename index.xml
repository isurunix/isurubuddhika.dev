I primarily work with Java (Backend) but, I know my way around the complete stack.

You might find me annoying if your code is not clean. I won&amp;rsquo;t accept your PRs unless those are clean and up to the standards.</description></item><item><title>Migrating to Hugo</title><link>https://isurubuddhika.dev/posts/migrating-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 20:42:46 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://isurubuddhika.dev/posts/migrating-to-hugo/</guid><description>I have always wanted to move away from wordpress and start writing my blogs in Markdown. Hell, I event thought of keeping the wordpress blog as it is and publish content off GitLab or GitHub to it.
But I always felt like it&amp;rsquo;s better to move on to a static site with my own domain. So finally I found the time to setup everything an get back on blogging again.</description></item></channel></rss>
