Hi, I'm Isuru Buddhika Pathirana (He/Him), and I'm a Software Engineer.

I primarily work with Java (Backend) but, I know my way around the complete stack.

I used to hate React and love Angular but, now I love both equally. (maybe React a little bit more)  

You might find me annoying if your code is not clean. I won't accept your PRs unless those are clean and up to the standards.

I occasionally write about my dev experiences, software engineering, open-source, and digital privacy.
I'm more of a reader than a writer, so don't expect frequent blogging. :wink:  

You can DM me on Twitter or contact me via hello\\**at**\isurubuddhika\\**dot**\me
