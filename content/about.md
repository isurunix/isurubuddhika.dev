Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Isuru Buddhika Pathirana** (He/Him), a senior engineer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

## What I Do

I spend my days architecting and building scalable distributed systems, leading development teams, and turning complex requirements into elegant technical solutions. While Java and Spring Boot are my bread and butter, I'm comfortable across the full stack and love diving into new technologies.

**My current tech obsessions:**
- Distributed architecture that actually scales
- DevOps practices that make deployment a joy
- AI-assisted development tools and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations
- Clean code that future-me will thank present-me for

## The Frontend Chronicles

I used to be *that guy* who hated React and swore by Angular. Plot twist: I now love both equally (okay, maybe React has a slight edge, but don't tell Angular). This journey taught me that the best technology is usually the one that solves your specific problem elegantly.

## My Philosophy

I'm passionate about code quality and believe that clean, well-tested code isn't just nice to haveâ€”it's essential. If your PR doesn't meet standards, we're going to have a friendly but firm conversation about it. Trust me, your future self will thank you.

I'm also deeply interested in the evolving landscape of AI-assisted development. Tools like GitHub Copilot and MCP-enabled AI agents are game-changers, but I view them as incredibly smart senior engineers who can write excellent codeâ€”except they don't have the full context of your problem or the architectural knowledge of your system. The magic happens when you combine AI efficiency with human judgment, architectural thinking, and thorough code review. We shouldn't offload our thinking to AI; instead, we should leverage these tools to write better code faster while keeping our brains firmly in the driver's seat.

## Why I Write

This blog is where I share my adventures in software engineering, thoughts on system design, open-source discoveries, AI-assisted development insights, and the occasional deep dive into how we can work more effectively with AI coding tools. I also explore digital privacy, the ethics of AI in development, and the balance between automation and human expertise. Fair warning: I'm more of a reader than a writer, so posts come when inspiration strikes rather than on a schedule. Quality over quantity, right? ðŸ˜‰

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems or reviewing code, you'll find me:
- Reading everything from technical documentation to science fiction
- Watching movies (the good, the bad, and the wonderfully terrible)
- Exploring the intersection of technology and philosophy
- Probably drinking coffee â˜•

## Let's Connect

Got questions about distributed systems? Want to debate the merits of different architectural patterns? Curious about AI-assisted development workflows or MCP integrations? Just want to chat about tech, books, or why human oversight is crucial when working with AI coding tools?

*"The best code is the code you don't have to write twice, and the best architecture is the one that scales gracefully with both traffic and team size."*
