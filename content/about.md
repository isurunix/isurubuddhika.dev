Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Isuru Buddhika Pathirana** (He/Him), a senior engineer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

## What I Do

I spend my days designing and building scalable distributed systems, leading development teams, and turning complex requirements into elegant technical solutions. While I mostly work with backend technologies like Java/SpringBoot, Kafka, Docker and MySQL, I'm comfortable across the full stack and love digging into new technologies.

**My current tech obsessions:**
- Clean and maintainable code (which is always my number one)
- Distributed architecture that actually scales
- AI-assisted development tools and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations
- DevOps practices that make deployment a joy

## Who I am

I'm passionate about code quality and believe that clean, well-tested code isn't just nice to haveâ€”it's essential. If your PR doesn't meet standards, we're going to have a friendly but firm conversation about it.

I used to be *that guy* who hated React and swore by Angular. But along the journey I became a React enthusiast. And also I firmly believe that the best technology is usually the one that solves your specific problem elegantly.

I'm also deeply interested in the evolving landscape of AI-assisted development. Tools like GitHub Copilot and MCP-enabled AI agents are great, but I believe the magic happens when you combine AI efficiency with human judgment, architectural thinking, and thorough code review. We shouldn't offload our thinking to AI; instead, we should leverage these tools to write better code faster while keeping our brains firmly in the driver's seat.

## Why I Write

This blog is where I share my adventures in software engineering, thoughts on system design, interesting discoveries and sometimes rants. I also explore digital privacy, the ethics of AI in development, and the balance between automation and human expertise. 

**Fair warning**: I'm more of a reader than a writer, so posts come when inspiration strikes rather than on a schedule. Quality over quantity, right? ðŸ˜‰

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not designing systems or looking at some weired code, you'll find me:
- Reading everything from technical documentation to science fiction
- Watching movies (the good, the bad, and the wonderfully terrible)
- Exploring the intersection of technology and philosophy
- Discussing with my inner voice about modern and greek philosophy
- Probably drinking coffee (or a beer if it's a Friday)

## Let's Connect

Got questions about distributed systems? Want to debate the merits of different architectural patterns? Curious about AI-assisted development workflows or MCP integrations? Just want to chat about tech, books, philosophy, or why human oversight is crucial when working with AI coding tools?

*"The best code is the code you don't have to write twice, and the best architecture is the one that scales gracefully with both traffic and team size."*
