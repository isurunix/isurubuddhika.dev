Lately I had was experimenting with PiHole just to see how much of my daily DNS queries ends up being trackers or ad urls.  
So I just configured PiHole docker on my laptop and configured my router to use it as the default DNS server.
I was happy with the result and overall DNS resolution times but felt that running PiHole is not gonna work unless I'm gonig to set it up with a Pi
or on a hosted server.
