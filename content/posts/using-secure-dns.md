## The Case for DNS-Level Ad Blocking: From Pi-hole to NextDNS

### The Setup

Sometime ago, I decided try out DNS-level ad blocking just to see how much of my daily internet traffic was being hijacked by ads and trackers. I set up Pi-hole using Docker on my laptop and configured my router to route all DNS queries through it. After sometime, I could see a breakdown of my network traffic—ads, trackers, and more, all being filtered out effortlessly. It was kinda cool but alarming at the same time because the sheer percentage of queries being blocked.

Also one other thing I noticed is speed improvements and reduced clutter on my devices were instantly noticeable. But as great as Pi-hole is, I knew my setup wasn’t ideal. Running it on a laptop wasn’t going to cut it long-term unless I dedicated a Raspberry Pi or a server to the task. This made me explore alternative solutions that is hosted on cloud and that's how I found NextDNS

### Why DNS-Level Ad Blocking?

To understand why DNS-level ad blocking is such a game-changer, let’s take a step back. Every time you type a website into your browser or open an app, a DNS query is made to translate that address into an IP. With DNS ad blocking, these queries are intercepted at the root, preventing ads and trackers from even reaching your device.

Here’s why it’s worth considering:

- **Performance Gains**: Pages load faster without those pesky ads and third-party scripts hogging bandwidth.
- **Enhanced Privacy**: No more trackers following you around the web.
- **Cross-Device Protection**: Set it up at the router level, and every device on your network—smartphones, laptops, even your smart fridge—gets covered.

### Why Pi-hole Remains a Fan Favorite

Pi-hole is nothing short of legendary among privacy enthusiasts. It gives you full control over your network’s DNS queries, complete with detailed dashboards and customization options. Themed interfaces like LCARS (for all the Star Trek fans out there) only add to its geeky charm. 

However, maintaining Pi-hole requires dedicated hardware or hosting, and for someone who didn't had the hardware to run a server at home and not enough money to run a cloud server, I needed something more portable and less costly. 
Enter **NextDNS**.

### NextDNS

NextDNS combines the power of DNS ad blocking with the convenience of a cloud-based service. That said, I naturally hesitated to trust my DNS queries to a third party. But a little research showed that NextDNS has taken significant steps to ensure privacy and security.

#### Addressing Privacy Concerns

NextDNS doesn’t sell, share, or license your data—ever. Its privacy policy is crystal clear on this point, and it’s independently run, which is a big plus. Even better, logging is off by default. If you do enable it, you can decide exactly what gets logged and for how long. Transparency is the name of the game here: you can view, export, or delete your data anytime.

To top it off, NextDNS uses advanced privacy techniques like Query Name Minimization and EDNS Client Subnet to ensure your IP address and browsing habits stay hidden from prying eyes.

#### A Mozilla Stamp of Approval

In 2019, Mozilla added NextDNS to its Trusted Recursive Resolver (TRR) program for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) in Firefox. This means NextDNS meets Mozilla’s rigorous privacy and security standards, which was reassuring for me as a user.

### Why I Love NextDNS

Once I started using NextDNS, it became clear to me that it's what I wanted in my setup Here’s what stood out:

- **Profiles for Every Device**: I can create different filtering rules for each device, tailoring the experience for work, gaming, or family use.
- **Always-On Protection**: Unlike Pi-hole, NextDNS works seamlessly across all networks, whether I’m at home or on the go.
- **Ridiculously Easy Setup**: No extra hardware, no tinkering. Just update your DNS settings, and you’re good to go.

### The Verdict

While I’ve moved on to NextDNS for its portability and ease of use, Pi-hole will always be the GOAT. It’s the DIY option that lets you take total control of your network, and nothing beats its customizability. If you’ve got the hardware and time, Pi-hole is a fantastic choice.

For everyone else, NextDNS offers a perfect balance between power and convenience. It’s a simple, effective way to take back control of your internet experience—faster, cleaner, and more private.

Whether you choose Pi-hole, NextDNS, or both, one thing’s for sure: DNS-level ad blocking is a must for anyone who values their privacy and sanity online.
