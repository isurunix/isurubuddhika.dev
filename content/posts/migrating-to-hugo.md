I have always wanted to move away from wordpress and start writing my blogs in Markdown.
Hell, I event thought of keeping the wordpress blog as it is and publish content off GitLab or GitHub to it.
But I always felt like it's better to move on to a static site with my own domain.
So finally I found the time to setup everything an get back on blogging again.
Let's see how would things turn out.
